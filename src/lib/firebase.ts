// This file is effectively no longer used as Firebase functionalities have been removed.
// It's kept temporarily empty or with minimal non-Firebase code to avoid breaking
// potential transitive imports during refactoring, but ideally, it (and any imports to it)
// should be removed if Firebase is fully deprecated from the project.

// To make this file a valid module and prevent other types of errors,
// you can add a simple export:
export {};
